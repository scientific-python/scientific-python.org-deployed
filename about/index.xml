      <description>Abstract Scientific Python is a consensus-based community project. Anyone with an interest in the project can join the community, contribute to the project design, and participate in the decision making process. This document describes how that participation takes place, how to find consensus, and how deadlocks are resolved.
Note that this document only applies to the Scientific Python project, which aims to better coordinate the ecosystem and prepare scientific Python for the next decade of data science.</description>
