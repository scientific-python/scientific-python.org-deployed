The Scientific Python ecosystem is a collection of open-source scientific software packages written in Python. It is a broad and ever-expanding set of algorithms and data structures that grew around NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.
The ecosystem includes a wide variety of tools: some more specialized to specific domains such as biological imaging or astronomy, and others quite general for tasks such as data management and high-performance computing.</description>

Before installing Scientific Python libraries, you need to have Python itself installed. There are two, largely equivalent, ways of doing that, and we describe both below.
If you have a working version of Python on your system already (check by running python3), you can skip to setting up a virtual environment.
Segment 1: Python.org This is the official Python distribution, which uses the pip package manager.</description>

Scientific Python is built on the Python programming language. Using Scientific Python therefore requires having a firm grasp of Python itself. We suggest reading through the official tutorial, doing an online tutorial on exercism, or using any of the countless resources that exist online or in print.
Learning a new language can be challenging, but Python is fun&amp;mdash;so keep trying and hang in there!</description>
